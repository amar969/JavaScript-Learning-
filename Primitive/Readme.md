# Primitive Data Types

1. String -- Used to represent characters and words 
2. Number -- used to represent numbers 
3. boolean -- used to represent true and false 
4. undefiend -- value is not assigned yet 
5. null -- value is null 

Why undefined == null gives true and undefined === null gives us false value? 
->  1. Null and undefined is true because both are falsy value -- hence it return true
    2. If check the strict type of it both are of different hence it return false
