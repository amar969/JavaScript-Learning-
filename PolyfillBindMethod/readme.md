# Polyfill for bind method 

Polyfill is a sort of browser fallback. What if suppose the user browser doesnâ€™t have the bind function and we have to write our own bind function. So we have to create our own function 

```
let name = {
	firstname: "Amarjeet",
	lastname: "Maurya", 
}

let printName = function() {
	console.log(this.firstname + " " + this.lastname)
}

let printMyName = printName.bind(name)
printMyName()

```

Above is the working of bind example, suppose we have to write our own bind function. Let see how to do it

```
Function.prototype.mybind = function(...args){
	let obj = this 
			// below params will extract the all elements after args[0]
			params = args.slice(1)
			return function(...args2){
				obj.apply(args[0], [params, ...args2])
			}
}

let printMyName2 = printName.mybind("Dehradun", "Uttarakhand")
printMyName2("India") 

```
