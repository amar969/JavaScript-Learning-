```
undefined == null 
```
- undefined is falsy value and null is also falsy value is just the abstract checking is not a strict type of checking. So the output is true 

```
undefined === null
```
- but if we do a strict evaluation it will be false. So undefined is not the same as null 

```
{} == {}
[] == []
```
- false because it refers to different memory locations
