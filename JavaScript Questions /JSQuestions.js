console.log(undefined == null)
// - undefined is falsy value and null is also falsy value is just the abstract checking is not a strict type of checking. So the output is true 

console.log(undefined === null)
// but if we do a strict evaluation it will be false. So undefined is not the same as null 


console.log([] === [])
console.log({} === {})
